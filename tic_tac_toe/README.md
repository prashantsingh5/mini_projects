The Tic Tac Toe game is a classic paper-and-pencil game played between two players on a grid of 3x3 squares. The objective of the game is to form a line of three matching symbols (either X or O) horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. This project aims to recreate the Tic Tac Toe game in a digital format, providing users with a platform to play against each other and showcase their strategic thinking and problem-solving skills.

I created this project to enhance my understanding and increase my knowledge in python language
